# Things to Do

7. Begin making a user profile page
8. Make a dynamic changing year footer 
9. In the dashboard (For now, the dashboard is just users posts)
- My posts
- My liked posts
- Stats
    - number of posts
10. Make a profile page
- theres a library called react-image-crop ~ could be interesting for 
    - profile pic cropping (start with preselected crop)
    - we need a 40x40 image!
    - locked?: boolean

12. On post preview, there will be a *t* where users can hover over, and that will give a popup of the tags of that book

13. Make even better tags:
    - have a hover effect for information on multiple tags
