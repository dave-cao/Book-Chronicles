# Things to Do

8. Make a dynamic changing year footer 
9. In the dashboard (For now, the dashboard is just users posts)
- My posts
- My liked posts
- Stats
    - number of posts
10. Make a profile page
- theres a library called react-image-crop ~ could be interesting for 
    - profile pic cropping (start with preselected crop)
    - we need a 40x40 image!
    - locked?: boolean


13. Make even better tags:
    - have a hover effect for information on multiple tags

Some cool libraries that you can use:

- Radix UI: highly customizable with many components
- Shadcn UI: built on top of Radix UI
- Material UI: material design proposed by google
